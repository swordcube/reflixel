# SuperFlixel
SuperFlixel is a remake of [HaxeFlixel](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel) without the Lime or OpenFL backends.

It will have a very similar file structure to HaxeFlixel, most likely with
some differences due to differing backends.

# Platforms
Due to not using Lime or OpenFL to develop this project, it will be extremely hard to
be cross-platform, so for the time being this will be desktop **only** via `hxcpp`.

The following platforms are natively supported:
